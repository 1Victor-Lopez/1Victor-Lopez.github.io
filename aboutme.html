            With the everlasting expansion of technology, the need for more coders are increased every week. 
            Plus, all of the greatest companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, etc. started with coding. Coding helps us understand the language of computers, the better we understand it, the better we can evolve/innovate it.

                    <li><hr>My greatest qualities are that I am diligent, determined, and a great listener.
            My greatest weakness is the fact that I get distracted easily, but I am working on it and am getting better.
            When it comes to school or work, I like to leave everything I am stressed about at the door.
            The problems I have outside of school or work usually do not have a negative impact on my assignments.

                    <li><hr>I have learned many things from my experiences in school and work. 
            In school, the more you connect with people, the better your grades because if you have friends in different classes then you can use them as references to your school work.
            I have only really worked with my dad, a general contractor, and from the long days to harsh workplaces the only thing that comes out of it is the feeling you get when you have finished with excellent work.
